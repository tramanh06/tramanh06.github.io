I'm a Research Assistant working on NLP applications under Prof. Jing Jiang. 
Previously during my undergrad studies, I did research with Prof. Ng Wee Keong on intersections of 
Security, Cryptography and Data Mining. 
I graduated with First Class Honours in Computer Science and Mathematics minor from Nanyang Technological University in 2016. 
After graduation, I spent 1.5 years as a software engineer in an investment bank, building ETL data pipeline systems, 
while heading a Machine Learning interest group. 

My research interests lie in Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing, especially Natural Language Understanding. 

Research Projects
-------------------
* Topic modelling for scientific authors
  * Research in topic model and Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Extend LDA for a hierarchical
  collection of documents
  * Build a ranking system to assign relevant reviewers to papers, 
  to automatically nominate reviewers during review process

* Financial Reporting using Machine Learning
  * Apply ML methods on financial transaction data
  * Enhance interpretability of ML system to understand the results
  * Replaces hand-coded rules with 99% accuracy







<!-- A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Getting started
------
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section
