I'm a Research Engineer working on NLP applications under Prof. [Jing Jiang](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/jingjiang/) at Singapore Management University. 
Previously, during my undergraduate studies, I did research with Prof. [Ng Wee Keong](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/awkng/) on intersections of 
Security, Cryptography and Data Mining. 
I graduated with First Class Honours in Computer Science and a Mathematics minor from Nanyang Technological University in 2016. 
<!-- After graduation, I spent 1.5 years as a software engineer in an investment bank, building ETL data pipeline systems, 
while heading a Machine Learning interest group.  -->

<!-- I have a deep interest for Mathematics and would love to do research in the intersection of Math and Computer Science. -->
My research interests lie in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, especially Natural Language Understanding. 

Research Projects

I've been fortunate to work on interesting projects in various research labs. 
I've worked on the first three projects since graduation; the remaining were done during
my undergraduate years,
either as a part-time Research Assistant or Research Intern. For more details of the projects, please go to [Projects](https://tramanh06.github.io/projects/).

Teaching
--------
**Math Tutor (2013-2018)**: Teaching Mathematics to Junior College students (Private Tutor)
<!-- Around Year 2 of my university year, I started missing doing Math a lot. There weren't that many Math-heavy courses in CS curriculum, and I haven't embarked on a Math minor by then. So I decided to teach Math to High School students as a way to keep my Math solving skills abreast. 
Since then, I've taught many Junior College students to prepare for their A-level examinations. It turns out not only do I love solving and thinking in Math, I also greatly enjoy teaching and making Math an easy subject for my students. -->


Fun facts
---------
I was fortunate enough to have piano lessons since very young. Because of that, I've developed huge interest in 
music, especially musical instruments. Besides piano, I've also picked up guitar, harp, drum and violin (I wish to learn cello next!). 
I used to be a Section Leader in a Harp Ensemble, as well as a guitarist/keyboarder/cajon-er in an acoustic band.
