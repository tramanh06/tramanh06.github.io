I'm a Research Assistant working on NLP applications under Prof. [Jing Jiang](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/jingjiang/). 
Previously during my undergraduate studies, I did research with Prof. [Ng Wee Keong](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/awkng/) on intersections of 
Security, Cryptography and Data Mining. 
I graduated with First Class Honours in Computer Science and a Mathematics minor from Nanyang Technological University in 2016. 
<!-- After graduation, I spent 1.5 years as a software engineer in an investment bank, building ETL data pipeline systems, 
while heading a Machine Learning interest group.  -->

I have a deep interest for Mathematics and would love to do research in the intersection of Math and Computer Science.
My research interests lie in Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing, especially Natural Language Understanding and Knowledge Representation.

Fun facts
=======
I was fortunate enough to have piano lessons since very young. Because of that, I've developed huge interest in 
music, especially musical instruments. Besides piano, I've also picked up guitar, harp, drum and violin. 
I used to play in a Harp Ensemble, as well as an acoustic band. 







<!-- A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Getting started
------
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section
